# Spot Nite - Collaborative music selection for your next get-together.

Spot nite allows any user to select and vote for songs played on a host's Spotify account. Users earn and lose points each time their songs are voted up or down in the queue. See who can win the most points and become the nights best DJ! 

To host a room, open your Spotify account and begin playing any music. Select "Host a Room" from Spot Nite and Login with your Spotify account (Spotify Premium Account required for full functionality). Your room will be ready to go! Friends can join your room by entering in the Room ID in "Join a Room."
